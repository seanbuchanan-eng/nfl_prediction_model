        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>The NFL Prediction website uses the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/">elo model</a>
            developed by FiveThirtyEight to predict the spread for upcoming NFL games. To improve the prediction
            of the spread, a small Neural Network is fed mean values over the past 14 games for points,
            elo, yards, and turnovers. The prediction is improved by half a point on average for the past
            ten years. Further improvements to the AI portion of the website will be made in the future.
        </p>
        <p>A prediction is given a green check in <a href="past_games.html">past games</a>
            if the predicted spread is within the bounds of the actual spread. Not if the 
            model predicts it exactly right. Given the randomness of game outcomes that would
            be unreasonable to expect.
